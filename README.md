# happy-or-sad

Discover if a text is happy/positive or sad/negative!

## How it works
It's actually very simple. Given a text it evaluates word by word if you text is more on a positive or negative side.

## To Do
* improve positive/negative concepts (not only based on a single word)
* UI could be more appellative :D

## Installation
Want to try? Easy as follows:
    git clone https://github.com/rubenfreitas/happy-or-sad

    cd happy-or-sad

    meteor
